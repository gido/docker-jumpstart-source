# Containers: Running instances of an Image

A container is a running image that you start with the `docker run` command, like this:

```console
$ docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
```

The command consists of:

* OPTIONS.  There are a LOT of options for the run command.  We'll cover this in a bit more depth in the next shortly. 
* IMAGE.  The name of the image that the container should start from.
* COMMAND.  The command that should run *on the container when it starts*.  

Let's try a simple command to to start a new container using the latest version of Ubuntu.  Once this container starts, you'll be at a bash shell where you can do `cat /etc/os-release` to see the release information about the OS:

```console
$ docker run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
root@4afa46473802:/# cat /etc/os-release 
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION="14.04.1 LTS, Trusty Tahr"
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS"
VERSION_ID="14.04"
HOME_URL="http://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="http://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
```

Next, type this command in your running container to make a simple change on the filesystem:

```console
root@4afa46473802:/# echo "hello world" > /tmp/hello.txt
```

Now that you've verified the OS release and created a test file, here's a bit more detail about the options we've used in the RUN command:

* The OPTIONS "-it" tell Docker to make the container interactive and provide a tty (i.e., attach a terminal)
* The IMAGE is the "ubuntu:latest" image we pulled down.  Note the *repository:tag* format, which is used throughout docker.  By default, the "latest" tag is used, but if we were to use "ubuntu:precise" we'd be using Ubuntu 12.04.
* The COMMAND is "/bin/bash", which starts a shell where you can log in

The cool thing is that once you're in an interactive docker shell, you can do anything you want, such as installing packages (via apt-get), code bases (using git), or dependencies (using pip, gem, npm, or any other package manager du jour.)  You can then commit the container at any point to create a new image that has your changes.  

To see this in action, open a new terminal on your host machine and use "docker ps" command to see some information about the running container:

```console
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
4afa46473802        ubuntu:14.04        /bin/bash           17 hours ago        Up 39 seconds                           jolly_perlman
```

This command will tell you:

* The CONTAINER\_ID, a unique identifier you can use to refer to the container in other commands (this is kind of like a process id in Linux)
* The IMAGE that was used when the container started
* The COMMAND used to start the container
* The time the underlying image was CREATED
* The uptime STATUS
* The exposed ports (lot's more on this!)
* A human readable NAME that you can use in place of the ID (this is something you can also assign yourself, which we'll get into shortly.)

Now try the `docker diff` command:

```console
$ docker diff jolly_perlman
C /tmp
A /tmp/hello.txt
```

As you can see, this command returns the changes that have happened on the filesystem, which in our case is that we've changed the "/tmp" directory by adding a "hello.txt" file.  Now let's commit the changes we've made into a new container:

```console
$ docker commit -m "Adding hello world" jolly\_perlman hello\_docker
5af244124dd8656...
```

Taking another look at `docker images` shows the effect; we now have a new image called "hello\_docker" that includes our "/tmp/hello.txt" file.  Taking a quick look at the container's history shows how our change added a whopping new 12 byte layer on top of the original layers of ubuntu:latest.

```console
$ docker history hello_docker
IMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY                                      SIZE
5af244124dd8        18 hours ago        /bin/bash                                       12 B

```

Finally, we can kill our docker process like this:

```console
$ docker kill jolly_perlman
jolly_perlman
```

If you do *docker ps* again, you'll see that the process has stopped. 

## Docker RUN Quick Reference

The next chapter will provide much more detail on how to create your own containers and images using *docker run*, one of the most feature-rich commands in Docker.  Taken directly from *docker help*, this table is a useful quick reference you can refer to as you go further with Docker.

| --expose=[]              |  Expose a port from the container without publishing it to your host
| -h, --hostname=""        |  Container host name
| -i, --interactive=false  |  Keep stdin open even if not attached
| --link=[]                |  Add link to another container (name:alias)
| --lxc-conf=[]            |  (lxc exec-driver only) Add custom lxc options --lxc-conf="lxc.cgroup.cpuset.cpus = 0,1"

| --name=""                |  Assign a name to the container
