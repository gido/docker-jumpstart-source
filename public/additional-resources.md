# Additional Resources

This Jumpstart guide has only scratched the surface of Docker.  This page is meant as a kind of living resource, so if you find helpful tools or resources, send me a pull request.

## Sites, Blogs, and Books

* [The Docker Documentation Page](http://docs.docker.com/userguide/).  Docker's documentation is great, if somewhat sprawling.    
* [The Docker Book](http://www.dockerbook.com/).  An awesome resource from [James Turnbull](http://www.jamesturnbull.net/), a prolific author and VP of Services at Docker, Inc. 
* [CenturyLink Labs](http://www.centurylinklabs.com/).  An amazing collection of how to articles and interviews with leading people in the Docker field.

## Other tools in the Docker ecosystem

Docker has a booming ecosystem of tools.  Here are a few of the more interesting ones that I'd love to write a chapter about some day:

* [fig](http://www.fig.sh/).  A tool for orchestrating and managing multi-container apps.
* [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/).  A slick, Mac-only alternative to boot2docker that provides a clean and simple way to install and run Docker containers.
* [Panamax](http://panamax.io/).  A tool for drag-and-drop deployment for containers.
